		For your paper to be published in the conference proceedings, you must use this document as both an instruction set and as a template into which you can type your own text. If your paper does not conform to the required format, you will be asked to fix it.
		
		Please do not reuse your past papers as a template. To prepare your paper for submission, please always download a fresh copy of this template from the conference website and please read the format instructions in this template before you use it for your paper.
		
		Conversion to PDF may cause problems in the resulting PDF or expose problems in your source document. Before submitting your final paper in PDF, check that the format in your paper PDF conforms to this template. Specifically, check the appearance of the title and author block, the appearance of section headings, document margins, column width, column spacing, and other features such as figure numbers, table numbers and equation number. In summary, you must proofread your final paper in PDF before submission.
		
		The maximum number of pages is 5. The 5\textsuperscript{th} page may be used exclusively for references. The references should begin on an earlier page immediately after the Acknowledgements section, and continue onto the 5\textsuperscript{th} page. If no space is available on an earlier page, then the references may begin on the 5\textsuperscript{th} page.
		
		Index terms should be included as shown below.

	\noindent\textbf{Index Terms}: speech recognition, human-computer interaction, computational paralinguistics
	
	\section{Introduction}
	
	This template can be found on the conference website. Templates are provided for Microsoft Word\textregistered, and \LaTeX. However, we highly recommend using \LaTeX when preparing your submission. Information for full paper submission is available on the conference website.
	
	\subsection{References}
	
	The reference format is the standard IEEE one. References should be numbered in order of appearance, for example \cite{Davis80-COP}.
	
	\section{Conclusions}
	
	Authors must proofread their PDF file prior to submission to ensure it is correct. Authors should not rely on proofreading the Word file. Please proofread the PDF file before it is submitted.
	
	\section{Acknowledgements}
	
	The ISCA Board would like to thank the organizing committees of the past INTERSPEECH conferences for their help and for kindly providing the template files. \\
	Note to authors: Authors should not use logos in acknowledgement section; rather authors should acknowledge corporations by naming them only.
